# Structify: a Structured Prompt Experiment

Structify is a structured prompt app built on [`assistant-ui`](https://github.com/Yonom/assistant-ui) and the Vercel AI SDK. A course project for CSE593.

## Environment Setup (conda + Node)

If you don't already have node.js globally and want to use conda to manage your environments, follow the instructions below.

1. Pick and activate a conda environment (check the name first):

conda env list
conda activate <your-env-name>

2. Install Node.js (with npm) inside that environment:

conda install -c conda-forge nodejs

> Requires Node.js ≥ 18.

## Local Development

1. Change into the project directory and install dependencies (first run only).

```console
npm install
```

2. Configure your OpenAI key by creating `.env.local` in the project root. You can find an example in `.env.example`.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

1. Start the dev server.

```console
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- Preloaded chat history: loaded from `data/initial-history.json` and shown immediately in the main `Thread` on startup.
- Prompt Cards sidebar: default cards and copy live in the `prompts` initial array inside `components/prompt-sidebar/prompt-sidebar.tsx`; edit that array to adjust the sidebar presets.
